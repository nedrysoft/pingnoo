# this script installs the required packages to build pingnoo on a fedora container.
# it is intended for internal use only when setting up build containers for CI

# http://download.proxmox.com/images/system/ contains all available containers, the proxmox GUI doesn't show a lot
# of these so you can manually download and install.
