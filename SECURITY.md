## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project encourages the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in line with industry best practices which include:
1.  Notifying the project owner
2.  Provide sufficient information to recreate the purported vulnerability.
3.  Allowing 90 days for remedial action to be taken before publishing details of security vulnerabilities

As this is a public project, we encourage you to commit improvements or use the issue tracker to report non critical security issues.

The team appreciate your input to making the platform more secure for all our users.
